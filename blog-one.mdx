## Redux to manage state in a React application

In {year}, Redux rapresents probably the better state management product in react world.
How redux works? It is a unidirectional dataflow.
A component dispatch an action to the reducer. 
Before the introduction of Redux toolkit it was more difficult to manage actions.
To manage action with side effects, as for example api calls, it was necessary to enhance the store with reduxThunk middleware.

Now with Redux toolkit Query it is easier, it manages syncronous or asyncronous actions without any middleware
It manages also the status of the async actions: Pending, success, error.<br/>
It is also easier to generate the actions creator from the reducer

The advantage of a state management what is? 
A central store allows us to update the state of the components without becoming crazy with props drilling

Without a state management the problem is that if the application is complex, an enterprise application has a big tree architecture, to share state between components could be difficult.
A nightmare with props drilling
